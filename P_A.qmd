# Quarter 1- Module 10: "Graphing Linear Equations"

## Lesson 1: Methods of Graphing a Linear Equation Given

A linear equation in two variables can be written either in the form *Ax + By = C* or *y = mx + b* where *A, B,* and *C* are real numbers, and *A* and *B* are not equal to zero. Graphing linear equations can be done using any of the three methods.

\(a\) Using any two points;

\(b\) Using x- and y- Intercepts;

\(c\) Using the slope and a point on the line

### Using Any Two Points

One method of graphing a linear equation is using any two points. Remember that two points are enough to draw the graph of a linear equation.

**Example 1**. Graph the linear equation y = 2x + 1.

**Solution:**

You may assign any two arbitrary values of x, say 0 and 1, and then solve for the corresponding value of y.

By substitution,

y = 2x + 1

When x = 0 When x = 1

y = 2(0) + 1 y = 2(1) + 1

y = 0 + 1 y = 2 + 1

**y = 1 y = 3**

Thus, the ordered pairs are (0, 1) and (1, 3). this means that the line passes through these points.

Plot these points and draw a line through them.![](P_A_files/Screenshot%202024-07-28%20143456.png)

### Using x-and y-intercept

Another way of graphing a linear equation in two variables is using the x-intercept **a** and y-intercept **b**. the x- and y- intercepts of the line could represent two points, which are (**a, 0**) and (**0, b**). Thus, the intercepts are enough to draw the graph of a linear equation.

**Example 2**. Graph the linear equation y = 2x + 1.

**Solution:**

To find the x-intercept of a line given its equation, let y = 0, then solve for x. To find the y-intercept of a line given its equation, let x = 0, then solve for y.

To find x-intercept, let y = 0.

y = 2x + 1

0 = 2x + 1 Substitution

\- 2x = 1 Addition Property of Equality

x = $-\frac{1}{2}$ Multiplication Property of Equality

Hence, the x-intercept is $-\frac{1}{2}$. In symbol, a = $-\frac{1}{2}$. Then the point in the x-axis is ($-\frac{1}{2}$, 0).

To find the y-intercept, let x = 0, then solve for y.

y = 2x + 1

y = 2(0) + 1 Substitution

y = 0 + 1 Identity property for Addition

y = 1

Hence, the y-intercept is 1. In symbol, b = 1. Then the point in the y-axis is (0, 1).

Now, plot the x- and y-intercepts, then draw a line that passes through them.

### Using the slope and a point on the line

Graphing linear equation can also be done using the slope and one point.

**Example 3**. Graph the line whose slope is 2 and contains the point (-1, -1).

**Solution:**

1.  Plot the given point. (-1, -1)

2.  Use the slope formula m = $\frac{rise}{run}$ to identify the rise and the run. The slope of the line is 2 which is equal to $\frac{2}{1}$.

    Note: *If the slope is positive, the graph moves upward; if the slope is negative, the graph moves downward.*

3.  Starting at the given point (-1, -1), count out the rise (*2 units up*) and run (*1 unit to the right*) to mark the second point. (Note That the slope is positive)

4.  Draw a line passing the points.

#### Group Activity

**Activity for Group 1**: Graph each linear equation that passes through the given pair of points.

2.  (5, 6) and (0, 11)
3.  (-2, $\frac{5}{3}$) and ($\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{1}{3}$)

**Activity for Group 2**: Graph each linear equation whose x-intercept *a*and y-intercept *b* are given below.

1.  *a* = 4 and *b* = -1
2.  *a*= $\frac{1}{2}$ and *b*= -2

**Activity for Group 3**: Graph the following equations given slope *m* and a point.

1.  *m* = $\frac{1}{2}$ and (0, 4)
2.  *m* = $\frac{3}{2}$ and (2, -3)

#### Assessment

Direction: Sketch the graph of each linear equation using any of the three methods presented. Using a graphing paper.

1.  x - y + 3 = 0
2.  y = $\frac{1}{4}x$ - 2
3.  y = $-\frac{3}{2}x$ + 1

#### Additional Activity / Assignment

Direction: Read and analyze the problem, then give the what is asked.

Mr. Vasco operates a bike rental service in the park. Initially it costs *Php* 15 to rent a bike, and an additional rent *Php* 5 for every hour you use it. Give the equation and show the graph representing the cost (y) of using the bike for (x) hours.
